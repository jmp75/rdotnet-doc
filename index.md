# Getting set up

* The recommended way to use R.NET is to use NuGet and add the [R.NET nuget package][rdotnet_nuget] as a dependency to your project/solutions. As of release 1.5.6, R.NET and its nuget package is platform independent (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
* You can also download a zip file with the binaries from the [R.NET site on codeplex][rdotnet_codeplex]
