R.NET 1.5.10 is a release towards R.NET 1.6. You are encouraged to use 1.5.10 now and give feedback: much testing has already been performed.

There are many major improvements compared to 1.5.5, many addressing issues reported repeatedly via the discussion forums. 

See the [documentation|documentation] for setup and usage instructions.

Highlights are: 
* R.NET binaries are now platform independent (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
* The REngine API has changed. While this will require existing users to adapt the engine initialisation in their code, this will prevent a lot of pitfalls for new users.
* Easier R engine initialization by default: R.NET tries to discover machine settings and R paths.
* Performance improvement in passing large arrays/vectors (up to 100 to 1000x faster for numeric/integer vectors)
* Improved error reporting and detailed error messages.
* Many bug fixes such as memory leaks, R startup parameters, calling generic functions, etc.
* Enhanced API for R function calls (.Invoke() methods) including support for named arguments.
* Limit the cases of faulty multi-threaded accesses to the R engine
